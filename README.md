# Medical Directory

#### Epicodus JavaScript exercise, August 10th 2018

#### By Ryan Putman

## Description

As we all know, everybody needs to see a doctor sometimes. But finding a doctor that provides the services you need nearby can be time consuming. To facilitate this, you have been asked to create a website where users may enter a medical issue (ie: “sore throat”, "rash", etc.) into a form, submit it, and receive a list of doctors in your city (Portland or Seattle depending on where you are) who can treat their medical issue.

## Specs

* A user should be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* A user should be able to to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data).
* If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is.
* If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)
